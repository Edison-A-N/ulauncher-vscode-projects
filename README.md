> [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io) extension that allows you to quickly open your VSCode projects, either managed by [VSCode Project Manager](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager) or directly from VSCode "Recent workspaces".

## Demo

## Requirements

- Ulauncher 5
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code
- [Project Manager](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager) extension. If not installed, you can still use this extension but will fall back to "Recent workspaces".

## Install

You must install the following Python packages required by this extension. You can run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
pip install --user memoization==0.3.1
```

In some Operating systems, you might have to run `pip3` instead of `pip`

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

```
https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-vscode-projects
```

## Usage

Type `vsp` into ulauncher input, to trigger this extension. You can optionally keep typing to filter the projects list.

[Project Manager](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager) managed projects will appear with the "briefcase" icon, while "Recent workspaces" will have a dark VSCode icon.

If you want to only see projects from one of these sources, you can configure it in the Plugin settings.

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/brpaz/vscode-projects
make link
```

The `make link` command will symlink the cloned repo into the appropriate location on the ulauncher extensions folder.

```
